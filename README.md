# Reedsy-Angular-SPA

Assignment Reedsy

A SPA app using AngularJS that lists books with sort and search functionality as well as a quick view of any chosen book.

# To Run 
Download on your machine by cloning in terminal with command :

```$ git clone https://github.com/nitinjhamtani/Reedsy-Angular-SPA.git```

then enter the folder using `$ cd Reedsy-Angular-SPA`.

Once in the directory, type the below line into your terminal:

```$ npm install```

After the install is complete, enter app folder and start a python server by typing the following in your command line: 

```$ cd app```  then,

```$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer``` 
(optionally, you can enter a port number after the SimpleHTTPServer to specify which port you would like to use)

NOTE: you need python installed on your machine for this to work, if you have homebrew installed you just need to type : 

```$ brew install python``` to download python on your machine. You can easily check if you already have python installed by typing ```$ python -v``` in your terminal.

Thats it! Navigate to localhost:port# in your browser and you can view the project live :)

Note: Python defaults to 8000 so you would go to: ```http://localhost:8000```.


However you can also run this project using xampp or wamp.

You just have to download or clone the git to htdocs folder and then run through ```http://localhost/yourfoldername/```.

Running through xampp is as simple as that.
